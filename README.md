# Dominator
This project is a python implementation of the card game Dominion, created by Donald X. Vaccarino. The aim is to create a playable version of the game using the python terminal, and later implement an AI which will learn to play the game from scratch using reinforcement learning in an unsupervised fashion, without any training data.
